 Note on Challenge Progress...


On Day 30 of the 100 Days of Code challenge, my laptop unexpectedly stopped working, which caused a brief pause in my progress.

However, the challenge was not abandoned — just temporarily paused and has now been resumed. I'm committed to completing all the planned days with consistency and quality.

Thanks for understanding!
